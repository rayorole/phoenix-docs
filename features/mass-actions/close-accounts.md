# Close accounts

### Why close your accounts?

Closing your accounts might be necessary for several reasons:

* **Security Concerns:** To prevent unauthorized access to your personal information.
* **Consolidation:** To simplify your finances by reducing the number of active accounts.
* **Inactivity Fees:** To avoid charges from accounts that require regular transactions.
