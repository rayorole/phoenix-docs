Use the wallet manager to create your main wallet types and up to 20 bundle wallets

### Distributing funds

To be able to bundle your launches you need to distribute your SOL to up to 20 wallets

We have 2 distribution methods at the moment:

* Fixed distribution, divide sol from funding wallet in equal amounts
* Randomized distribution

{% hint style="info" %}
We are working on an aging system for your bundler wallets too, so your wallets do not get flagged on trading platforms like Bullx
