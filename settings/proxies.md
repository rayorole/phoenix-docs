### Setting up your proxies

Once you have some proxies readt, you can start using them in Phoenix.

Head over to your [Proxies settings page](https://dashboard.phoenixtools.app/settings/proxies) to add your proxy.

Adding a proxy is easy, just enter the IP and port, if you need a username and password, you can enter that too.

### Connecting to your proxy

Since you cannot connect to your proxy from within your browser directly from the dashboard, you need to download our proxy manager extension on the Chrome webstore.
